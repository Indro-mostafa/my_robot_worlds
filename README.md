# my_robot_worlds
For our robot simulations, we have developed a package, `my_robot_worlds`,
which comprises a set of diverse open source virtual environments, carefully 
designed to replicate various real-world scenarios. These environments 
provide robots with the challenges and situations they might face in the
physical world.The worlds and models files  are sourced from  this **[leonhartyao](https://github.com/leonhartyao/gazebo_models_worlds_collection)**, which provides a collection of pre-designed environments.

In this package, each environment comes with a dedicated ROS launch file. These files simplify the process of loading the respective environments into Gazebo.
